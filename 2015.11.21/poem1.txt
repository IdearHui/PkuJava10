I Think I Can 

If you think you are beaten, you are; 
If you think you dare not, you don't; 
If you want to win but think you can't; 
It's almost a cinch you won't. 
If you think you'll lose, you're lost; 
For out of the world we find 
Success begins with a fellow's will; 
It's all in a state of mind. 
Life's battles don't always go 
To the stronger and faster man, 
But sooner or later the man who wins 
Is the man who thinks he can.
